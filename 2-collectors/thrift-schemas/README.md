# Thrift Raw Event

## Introduction

This project contains [Thrift][thrift] schemas, each in its own subproject.

The current schemas are:

* CollectorPayload: for the raw events generated by the Scala Stream Collector
* SnowplowRawEvent: the legacy version of CollectorPayload
* SchemaSniffer: used to infer the schema which was used to deserialize a binary Thrift record

The Thrift IDL is defined within a Scala/SBT project to produce Java sources and publish to Snowplow's maven repository. Tests are written using ScalaCheck.

## Using with Scala/SBT

1. Add the Snowplow maven repository as a [resolver][dependencies]:
   `"Snowplow Analytics Maven repo" at "http://maven.snplow.com/releases/"`
2. Add the following as a [dependency][dependencies]:
   `"com.snowplowanalytics" % "collector-payload1" % "0.0.0"`
