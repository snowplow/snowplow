# Clojure Collector

## Introduction

The Clojure Collector is an event collector for [SnowPlow][snowplow], written in Clojure. It sets a third-party cookie, allowing user tracking across domains. It is designed to be easy to setup on [Amazon Elastic Beanstalk][elastic-beanstalk].

The Clojure Collector relies on [Tomcat][tomcat] for SnowPlow event logging, and is built on top of [Ring][ring] and [Compojure][compojure].
