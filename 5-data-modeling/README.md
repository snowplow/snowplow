# Data modeling

![architecture][architecture-image]

## What is data modeling?

Once the [storage step][storage] is done loading enriched events into our storage target of choice, we can start to use that data to build intelligence.

Whilst it is possible to query the events directly, it is often more convenient to transform and aggregate the events into a set of tables that are then used by various data consumers within the business. This has a number of advantages:

1. It guarantees that all users within the business are using the same basic business logic (e.g. identity stitching and sessionization);
2. It is easier and faster to run queries against the modeled data
4. It is possible to connect a BI or pivoting tool directly to the aggregate data

## What data models are available?

### Web model
The [new generation][data-models-blogpost] of Snowplow officially-supported SQL data models for working with Snowplow data. There are two ways to run the Web model, depending on your choice of tooling to execute SQL against your database.

#### SQL-Runner version

- Supports Redshift, Snowflake and BigQuery.
- Can be found in the dedicated [data models GitHub repository][data-models].

#### dbt version

- Supports Redshift only. BigQuery and Snowflake to follow.
- Can be found in the dedicated [dbt-snowplow-web GitHub repository][dbt-snowplow-web-repo].
- Leverages functionality provided by the [snowplow-utils dbt package][dbt-snowplow-utils-repo].

### Mobile model

The first generation of Snowplow officially-supported SQL data models for working with Snowplow mobile data can be found in the dedicated [data models GitHub repository][data-models]. Redshift, BigQuery and Snowflake are supported using SQL-Runner, with a dbt based model to follow soon.
