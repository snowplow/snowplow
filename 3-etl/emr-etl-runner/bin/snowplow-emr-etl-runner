# This Ruby script runs the daily ETL (extract, transform, load)
# process which transforms the raw CloudFront log data into
# SnowPlow-formatted Hive data tables, optimised for analysis.
#
# This is a three-step process:
# 1. Extract the CloudFront log files to a temporary SnowPlow event data table (using the custom Deserializer)
# 2. Load the temporary event data into the final SnowPlow data table, partitioning by date and user
# 3. Archive the CloudFront log files by moving them into a separate bucket
#
# Note that each step is only actioned if the previous step succeeded without error.
