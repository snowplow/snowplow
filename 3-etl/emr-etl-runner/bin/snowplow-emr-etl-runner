# This Ruby script runs the daily ETL (extract, transform, load)
# process which transforms the raw CloudFront log data into
# SnowPlow-formatted Hive data tables, optimised for analysis.
#
# This is a three-step process:
# 1. Transfer the raw CloudFront logs from the In Bucket to the Processing Bucket
# 2. Run the Hive ETL process on the logs using Amazon EMR (populates processed SnowPlow events into the Out Bucket)
# 3. Archive the processed CloudFront logs from Processing Bucket to Archive Bucket
#
# Note that each step is only actioned if the previous step succeeded without error.
