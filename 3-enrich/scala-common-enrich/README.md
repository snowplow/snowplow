# Scala Common Enrich

## Introduction

Scala Common Enrich is a shared library for processing raw Snowplow events into validated and enriched Snowplow events, ready for loading into [Storage] [storage].

Scala Common Enrich provides record-level enrichment only: feeding in 1 raw Snowplow event will yield 0 or 1 records out, where a record may be an enriched Snowplow event or a reported bad record.

Scala Common Enrich is designed to be used within a "host" enrichment process. The currently supported host enrichment processes are our [Hadoop Enrichment] [hadoop-enrich] and [Kinesis Enrichment] [kineses-enrich].
