# Scala Hadoop Enrichment

## Introduction

This is the Snowplow ETL process implemented for Hadoop using [Scalding] [scalding]. The Hadoop ETL parses raw SnowPlow event logs, extracts the SnowPlow events, enriches them (e.g. with geo-location information) and then writes them out to SnowPlow-format event files.

The SnowPlow Hadoop ETL process is an alternative to the SnowPlow [Hive ETL] [hive-etl] process.

## Technical overview

The SnowPlow Hadoop ETL process is written in [Scalding] [scalding], the Scala library/DSL on top of [Cascading] [cascading], the Java data processing framework which in turn wraps Hadoop.

Like the Hive ETL, the Hadoop ETL can be run on [Amazon Elastic MapReduce] [emr] using the [EmrEtlRunner] [emr-etl-runner] Ruby app.

## Building

Assuming you already have SBT installed:

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/snowplow.git
    $ cd 3-enrich/hadoop-etl
    $ sbt assembly

The 'fat jar' is now available as:

    target/snowplow-hadoop-etl-0.1.0.jar

## Testing

The `assembly` command above does not (currently) run the test suite - but you can run this manually with:

    $ sbt test

If you get errors reported in some tests, run those tests individually with `test-only com.snowplowanalytics...TestName` and they should pass fine.
