# Stream Enrich

## Introduction

Stream Enrich processes raw [Snowplow][snowplow] events from an input
[Amazon Kinesis][kinesis] stream and [NSQ][nsq], stores enriched events
into output Kinesis streams.
Events are enriched using the [scala-common-enrich][common-enrich] library.

## Building

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/snowplow.git
