-- The standard model identifies sessions using only first party cookies and session domain indexes,
-- but contains placeholders for identity stitching.

-- Events belonging to the same session can arrive at different times and could end up in different batches.
-- Rows in the sessions_new table therefore have to be merged with those in the pivot table.

-- Backup the current sessions pivot table.
