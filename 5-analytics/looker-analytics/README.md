# Looker Metadata Model for Snowplow

## Introduction

Looker is a next-generation BI tool that is particularly well suited to analyse Snowplow data.

The metadata model included in this repo is a starting point to enable Snowplow users to get up and running quickly with Looker. It includes common dimensions and metrics that are likely to be useful to a broad range of Snowplow users e.g.

* New vs returning visitor
* Date / time a user first touched the website
* Number of transactions, events, page views and page pings per visit and per visitor

It should be straightforward for Snowplow users to build on this basic model to build e.g.:

* Business-specific audience segments
* Recognise business-specific events on a user journey and join them together to form business-specific funnels
* Develop business-specific metrics
