# Kinesis Elasticsearch Sink

## Introduction

The Kinesis Elasticsearch Sink consumes Snowplow enriched events or failed events from an [Amazon Kinesis][kinesis] stream, transforms them to JSON, and writes them to [Elasticsearch][elasticsearch]. Events which cannot be transformed or which are rejected by Elasticsearch are written to a separate Kinesis stream.

## Building

Assuming you already have [SBT 0.13.0] [sbt] installed:

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/snowplow.git
    $ cd 4-storage/kinesis-elasticsearch-sink
    $ sbt compile
    
## Usage

The Kinesis Elasticsearch Sink has the following command-line interface:

```
snowplow-elasticsearch-sink: Version 0.1.0. Copyright (c) 2014, Snowplow Analytics
Ltd.

Usage: snowplow-elasticsearch-sink [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS
--config filename
                   Configuration file.
```

## Running

Create your own config file:

    $ cp src/main/resources/application.conf.example my.conf

Edit it and update the AWS credentials:

```js
aws {
  access-key: "default"
  secret-key: "default"
}
```

Next, start the sink, making sure to specify your new config file:

    $ sbt "run --config my.conf"
