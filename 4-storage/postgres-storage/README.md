# PostgreSQL storage for SnowPlow

## Introduction

[PostgreSQL][postgres] ("Postgres") is an advanced open-source Object-Relational DBMS. Postgres is an excellent storage target for Snowplow data, supporting a variety of rich SQL querying techniques (e.g. [windowing][window-functions]) as well as connections to a variety of BI and dashboarding tools.

Hosted options for Postgres include [Heroku][heroku] and [Engine Yard][engine-yard], with a [full list of hosting providers][hosted-postgres] available from PostgreSQL themselves.
