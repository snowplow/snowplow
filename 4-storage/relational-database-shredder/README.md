# Relational Database Shredder

## Introduction

This is a [Scalding] [scalding] job which:

1. Reads Snowplow enriched events from S3
2. Extracts any unstructured event JSONs and context JSONs found
3. Validates that these JSONs conform to schema
4. Adds metadata to these JSONs to track their origins
5. Writes these JSONs out to nested folders dependent on their schema

It is designed to be run by the [EmrEtlRunner] [emr-etl-runner] immediately after the [Scala Hadoop Enrich] [scala-hadoop-enrich] job.
