  As explained in the blog post here https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2020/07/16/changing-releasing/ all the components of Snowplow pipeline have been moved to their own repo.

Issues should be created directly on the appropriate repo: https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/tree/master#trackers

Please do not log an issue if you are asking for support, all of our community support requests go through
our Discourse forum: https://discourse.snowplowanalytics.com/.

Posting your problem there ensures more people will see it and you should get support faster than creating a new issue on
GitHub. Please do create a new issue on GitHub if you think you've found a bug though!
