# Snowplow Issues

As explained in the [blog post here](https://snowplowanalytics.com/blog/2020/07/16/changing-releasing/) all the components of Snowplow pipeline have been moved to their own repositories.

Issues should be created directly on the [appropriate repositories](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow#about-this-repository).

Please do not log an issue if you are asking for support, all of our community support requests go through our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.snowplowanalytics.com/).

Posting your problem on Discourse ensures more people will see it and you should get support faster than creating a new issue on GitHub. Please do create a new issue on the appropriate GitHub repository if you think you've found a bug though!
