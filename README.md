## Overview

Snowplow is an enterprise-strength marketing and product analytics platform. It does three things:

1. Identifies your users, and tracks the way they engage with your website or application
2. Stores your users' behavioral data in a scalable "event data warehouse" you control: Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake or Elasticsearch
3. Lets you leverage the biggest range of tools to analyze that data, including big data tools (e.g. Spark) via EMR or more traditional tools e.g. Looker, Mode, Superset, Re:dash to analyze that behavioral data

**To find out more, please check out the [Snowplow website][website] and the [docs website][docs].**

### Version Compatibility Matrix

For compatibility assurance, the version compatibility matrix offers clarity on our recommended stack. It is strongly recommended when setting up a Snowplow pipeline to use the versions listed in the version compatibility matrix which can be found [within our docs][version-compatibility].

### Public Roadmap

This repository also contains the [Snowplow Public Roadmap][roadmap]. The Public Roadmap lets you stay up to date and find out what's happening on the Snowplow Platform. Help us prioritize our cards: open the issue and leave a üëç to vote for your favorites. Want us to build a feature or function? Tell us by heading to our [Discourse forum][discourse] üí¨.

### Try Snowplow

Setting up a full open-source Snowplow pipeline requires a non-trivial amount of engineering expertise and time investment.
You might be interested in finding out what Snowplow can do first, by setting up [Try Snowplow][try-snowplow].

### Our Commercial Offering

If you wish to get everything setup and managed for you, you can consider [Snowplow Insights][insights]. You can also [request a demo][request-a-demo].

## Snowplow technology 101

[![Snowplow architecture][architecture-image]][architecture]

The repository structure follows the conceptual architecture of Snowplow, which consists of six loosely-coupled sub-systems connected by five standardized data protocols/formats.

To briefly explain these six sub-systems:

* **[Trackers][trackers]** fire Snowplow events. Currently we have 15 trackers, covering web, mobile, desktop, server and IoT
* **[Collector][collector]** receives Snowplow events from trackers. Currently we have one official collector implementation with different sinks: Amazon Kinesis, Google PubSub, Amazon SQS, Apache Kafka and NSQ
* **[Enrich][enrich]** cleans up the raw Snowplow events, enriches them and puts them into storage. Currently we have several implementations, built for different environments (GCP, AWS, Apache Kafka) and one core library
* **[Storage][storage]** is where the Snowplow events live. Currently we store the Snowplow events in a flat file structure on S3, and in the Redshift, Postgres, Snowflake and BigQuery databases
* **[Data modeling][data-modeling]** is where event-level data is joined with other data sets and aggregated into smaller data sets, and business logic is applied. This produces a clean set of tables which make it easier to perform analysis on the data. We officially support data models for Redshift, Snowflake and BigQuery.
* **[Analytics][analytics-sdks]** are performed on the Snowplow events or on the aggregate tables.

**For more information on the current Snowplow architecture, please see the [Technical architecture][architecture]**.

## About this repository

This repository is an umbrella repository for all loosely-coupled Snowplow components and is updated on each component release.

Since June 2020, all components have been extracted into their dedicated repositories (more info [here][split-blogpost])
and this repository serves as an entry point for Snowplow users, the home of our public roadmap and as a historical artifact.

Components that have been extracted to their own repository are still here as [git submodules][submodules].
