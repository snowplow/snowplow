As of January 8, 2024,  Snowplow is introducing the Snowplow Limited Use License Agreement, and we will be releasing new versions of our core behavioral data pipeline technology under this license.

Our mission to empower everyone to own their first-party customer behavioral data remains the same. We value all of our users and remain dedicated to helping our community use Snowplow in the optimal capacity that fits their business goals and needs. 

We reflect on our Snowplow origins and provide more information about these changes in our blog post here ‚Üí https://eu1.hubs.ly/H06QJZw0

## Overview

Snowplow is a developer-first engine for collecting behavioral data. In short, it allows you to:

* Collect events such as impressions, clicks, video playback (or even custom events of your choosing).
* Store the data in a scalable data warehouse you control ([Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), [Databricks](https://databricks.com/product/databricks-sql), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/workloads/data-warehouse-modernization/)) or emit it via a stream ([Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/), [Google PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)).
* Leverage a wide range of tools to model and analyze the behavioral data: [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Looker](https://www.looker.com/), [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/), [Mode](https://mode.com/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), [Redash](https://redash.io/), and more.

Thousands of organizations like Burberry, Strava, and Auto Trader rely on Snowplow to collect, manage, and operationalize real-time event data from their central data platform to uncover deeper customer journey insights, predict customer behaviors, deliver differentiated customer experiences, and detect fraudulent activities.

## Snowplow technology 101

[![Snowplow architecture][architecture-image]][architecture]

The repository structure follows the conceptual architecture of Snowplow, which consists of six loosely-coupled sub-systems connected by five standardized data protocols/formats.

To briefly explain these six sub-systems:

* **[Trackers][trackers]** fire Snowplow events. Currently we have 15 trackers, covering web, mobile, desktop, server and IoT
* **[Collector][collector]** receives Snowplow events from trackers. Currently we have one official collector implementation with different sinks: Amazon Kinesis, Google PubSub, Amazon SQS, Apache Kafka and NSQ
* **[Enrich][enrich]** cleans up the raw Snowplow events, enriches them and puts them into storage. Currently we have several implementations, built for different environments (GCP, AWS, Apache Kafka) and one core library
* **[Storage][storage]** is where the Snowplow events live. Currently we store the Snowplow events in a flat file structure on S3, and in the Redshift, Postgres, Snowflake and BigQuery databases
* **[Data modeling][data-modeling]** is where event-level data is joined with other data sets and aggregated into smaller data sets, and business logic is applied. This produces a clean set of tables which make it easier to perform analysis on the data. We officially support data models for Redshift, Snowflake and BigQuery.
* **[Analytics][analytics-sdks]** are performed on the Snowplow events or on the aggregate tables.

**For more information on the current Snowplow architecture, please see the [Technical architecture][architecture]**.

## About this repository

This repository is an umbrella repository for all loosely-coupled Snowplow components and is updated on each component release.

Since June 2020, all components have been extracted into their dedicated repositories (more info [here][split-blogpost])
and this repository serves as an entry point for Snowplow users and as a historical artifact.

Components that have been extracted to their own repository are still here as [git submodules][submodules].

### Trackers
