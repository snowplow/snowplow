## Overview

Snowplow is a developer-first engine for collecting behavioral data. In short, it allows you to:

* Collect events such as impressions, clicks, video playback (or even custom events of your choosing).
* Store the data in a scalable data warehouse you control ([Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/), [Databricks](https://databricks.com/product/databricks-sql), [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/), [Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/workloads/data-warehouse-modernization/)) or emit it via a stream ([Amazon Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/), [Google PubSub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview), [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)).
* Leverage a wide range of tools to model and analyze the behavioral data: [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/), [Looker](https://www.looker.com/), [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/), [Mode](https://mode.com/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Superset](https://superset.apache.org/), [Redash](https://redash.io/), and more.

Thousands of organizations around the world generate, enhance, and model behavioral data with Snowplow to fuel [advanced analytics](https://snowplowanalytics.com/advanced-analytics/?utm_source=github&utm_content=main-repo), [AI/ML initiatives](https://snowplowanalytics.com/ai-ml/?utm_source=github&utm_content=main-repo), or [composable CDPs](https://snowplowanalytics.com/composable-cdp/?utm_source=github&utm_content=main-repo).

## Snowplow technology 101

[![Snowplow architecture][architecture-image]][architecture]

The repository structure follows the conceptual architecture of Snowplow, which consists of six loosely-coupled sub-systems connected by five standardized data protocols/formats.

To briefly explain these six sub-systems:

* **[Trackers][trackers]** fire Snowplow events. Currently we have 15 trackers, covering web, mobile, desktop, server and IoT
* **[Collector][collector]** receives Snowplow events from trackers. Currently we have one official collector implementation with different sinks: Amazon Kinesis, Google PubSub, Amazon SQS, Apache Kafka and NSQ
* **[Enrich][enrich]** cleans up the raw Snowplow events, enriches them and puts them into storage. Currently we have several implementations, built for different environments (GCP, AWS, Apache Kafka) and one core library
* **[Storage][storage]** is where the Snowplow events live. Currently we store the Snowplow events in a flat file structure on S3, and in the Redshift, Postgres, Snowflake and BigQuery databases
* **[Data modeling][data-modeling]** is where event-level data is joined with other data sets and aggregated into smaller data sets, and business logic is applied. This produces a clean set of tables which make it easier to perform analysis on the data. We officially support data models for Redshift, Snowflake and BigQuery.
* **[Analytics][analytics-sdks]** are performed on the Snowplow events or on the aggregate tables.

**For more information on the current Snowplow architecture, please see the [Technical architecture][architecture]**.

### Version Compatibility Matrix

To make sure all the components work well together, we strongly recommended you take a look at the [compatibility matrix][version-compatibility] when setting up a Snowplow pipeline.

## About this repository

This repository is an umbrella repository for all loosely-coupled Snowplow components and is updated on each component release.

Since June 2020, all components have been extracted into their dedicated repositories (more info [here][split-blogpost])
and this repository serves as an entry point for Snowplow users, the home of our public roadmap and as a historical artifact.

Components that have been extracted to their own repository are still here as [git submodules][submodules].

### Trackers
