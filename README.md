# SnowPlow

## Introduction

SnowPlow is the world's most powerful web analytics platform. It does three things:

* Identifies users, and tracks the way they engage with a website or web-app
* Stores the associated data in a scalable “clickstream” data warehouse
* Makes it possible to leverage a big data toolset (e.g. Hadoop, Pig, Hive) to analyse that data

**To find out more, please check out the [SnowPlow Wiki] [wiki].**

## SnowPlow technology 101

The repository structure follows the conceptual architecture of SnowPlow, which consists of five loosely coupled stages:

To briefly explain these five sub-systems:

* **Trackers** fire SnowPlow events. Currently we have a JavaScript tracker; iOS and Android trackers are on the roadmap
* **Collectors** receive SnowPlow events from trackers. Currently we have a simple CloudFront-based collector
* **ETL (extract, transform and load)** cleans up the raw SnowPlow events, enriches them and puts them into storage. Currently we have a Hive-based ETL process
* **Storage** is where the SnowPlow events live. Currently we store the SnowPlow events in a Hive-format flatfile structure on S3
* **Analytics** are performed on the SnowPlow events. Currently we have a set of ad hoc analyses written in Hive 

**For more information on the current SnowPlow architecture, please see the [Technical architecture] [architecture-doc]**.

## Contributing

We're committed to a loosely-coupled architecture for SnowPlow and would love to get your contributions within each of the five sub-systems.

If you would like help implementing a new tracker, trying a different ETL approach or loading SnowPlow events into an alternative database, **[get in touch] [contact]**!
