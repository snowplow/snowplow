# Java Analytics for Snowplow

## Overview

Add analytics to your Java programs and data pipelines with the [Snowplow] [snowplow] event tracker for [Java] [java].

## Quick Start

### Downloads

There are a few ways to get the Java tracker started. Adding the jar file to your project dependencies is the recommended method of getting started. Since production is still early and large changes are being made daily, jar files may not be up to date. Check the version associated with the jar. Class files can be found in the out folder. At the moment the source files are set up as a package.

#### Easiest Method - Jar:

The quickest and easiest way to incorporate the Snowplow Java Tracker into your project is downloading all the files using

    git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow.git
    cd snowplow/1-trackers/java-tracker

You should now see all the java tracker files, including a folder called JavaPlow_VERSION_jar. Add the jar file in there to your projects dependencies.

Here are setup options for popular IDEs: [IntelliJ 13][intellij] or [Eclipse][eclipse].

Thats it! Skip down to setting up the tracker.

#### Source Files: 

To get started with the javaplow source files, download the javaplow package and either add the javaplow jar file to the list of dependencies or install the three library dependencies [Here][dependencies].

Place the javaplow package in your projects src folder or root. If performed correctly you should be able to compile and ready to instantiate a tracker.

### Set up the Tracker

Documentation on functions are available [here][documentation]. 

All Snowplow java-tracker files are part of the `com.snowplow.javaplow` package. Before you can work with them you must `import` them as follows:

    import com.snowplow.javaplow.*;

To instantiate a tracker in your code (can be global or local to the process being tracked) simply instantiate the `Tracker` interface with one of the following:

    TrackerC(String collector_URI, String namespace)

    TrackerC(String collector_uri, String namespace, String app_id, String context_vendor, boolean base64_encode, boolean enable_contracts)

e.g.

    Tracker t1 = new TrackerC("d3rkrsqld9gmqf.cloudfront.net", "Snowplow Java Tracker Test", "testing_app", "com.snowplow", true, true);

There are more options you can configure, which will be documented soon. 

    t1.setUserID("Kevin Gleason"); 
    t1.setLanguage("eng");
    t1.setPlatform("cnsl");
    t1.setScreenResolution(1260, 1080);
    t1.track();

----

Now, locally in the function you would like to track, place a tracking call to one of the supported methods. Currently implemented are:

    t1.track_page_view(String page_url, String page_title, String referrer, String context)

    t1.track_struct_event(String category, String action, String label, String property, int value, String vendor, String context)

    t1.track_unstruct_event(String eventVendor, String eventName, String dictInfo, String context)

    t1.track_screen_view(String name, String id, String context)

    t1.track_ecommerce_transaction_item(String order_id, String sku, Double price, Integer quantity, String name, String category, String currency, String context, String transaction_id) *

    t1.track_ecommerce_transaction(String order_id, Double total_value, String affiliation, Double tax_value,Double shipping, String city, String state, String country, String currency, List<Map<String, String>> items, String context) *

###### * Tested and succeeded, but not as much as other functions. Potentially contains bugs.

And thats it! When the tracking function is called, all the information gathered will be sent to the collector URI you have set!

Now you're ready to [view the documentation][documentation]!

Dont have the collector configured? [See Snowplow setup] [setup]

#### Don't need to fill in every field?

A few fields are required, like collector_uri and namespace, or page_url or catrgory and action etc. For the most part, if you dont need a field you can use null! The code will convert those values whether they be number or letters to empty strings which in turn will not show up in the final database.

## Comments

- For a full list of available functions, look into the packages interfaces.
- Context is meant to be in JSON String format

    `String i = "{'Movie':'Shawshank Redemption', 'Time':'100 Minutes' }"`
