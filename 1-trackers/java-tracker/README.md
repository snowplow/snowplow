# Java Analytics for Snowplow

## Overview

Add analytics to your Java programs and data pipelines with the [Snowplow] [snowplow] event tracker for [Java] [java].

## Current Build

Since production is still early and large changes are being made daily, jar files may not be up to date, check the version associated with the jar. Class files can be found in the out folder. At the moment the source files are set up as a package.

To get started, move into the src folder and follow the set up guide!

Note: The set up there is for the package "com.snowplow.javaplow", this means you should leave all source files in the folders, and drag the entire package folder into your project. 

### About the Tracker

All tracking methods have been tested successfully, but more bugs are discovered every day. If you find one, let me know by email or github.
